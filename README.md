HELLO EVERYONE !!!!! This Is My First Gui App EVERRR!!! it took me two weeks to do this with (p)OOP ðŸ˜£ and then i eventually gave up cuz i couldn't do it ðŸ˜ž Then I Made This The Right Way !!, it took me two days ðŸ¤¦ BUT !! , nevertheless i wanna thank BRO CODE (THE TKINTER TUTORIAL) , CODE WITH JOSH (the inspiration for the idea),JOHAN GODINHO(bank tutorial) so to run this everything is included in python (hopefully) you don't need to install anything and ENJOY :) (excuse any language mistakes english isn't my first language ðŸ˜›)
JUST RUN THE "gui.py" FILE IN YOUR TERMINAL OR IDE AND THAT'S it !!!!!!
(THE "banksys.py" FILE WAS THE INSPIRATION FOR THIS PROJECT YOU CAN TRY IT OR JUST IGNORE IT)
